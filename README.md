## 🖋️ Visualizing Logic
"Elegance is the art of concealing complexity behind simplicity."

I believe that **Diagram as Code (DaC)** is the future of technical documentation.

- 🎨 **Aesthetic**: Minimalist (B&W), High-contrast, Functional.
- 📚 **Mission**: Translating messy software logic into clean, readable Mermaid diagrams.
- 🛠️ **Current Project**: Optimizing [Mermaid-Live-Editor] for local high-performance use.
